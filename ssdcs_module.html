										<h2>Lessons learnt and key outcomes</h2>

									</header>

									<p>By the units mentioned below, I understood the fundamentals of secure software development and critically assess its components and learn from case studies involving cryptographic failures to design secure, purpose-built, industry-grade, successful software systems adopting security-related principles, best practices, and methodologies. These techniques involved appropriate gathering of requirements, analysis, design, software implementation and testing for secure software development. Thereafter, I learnt to appreciate related achitectural principles and leverage them in traditional and contemporary Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models, such as TOGAF and Agile, to build a secure, CRUD-functional internet forensics-related command line interface (CLI)-based application. Throughout these endeavours, I learnt how to design and develop secure software systems to streamline and inform business decisions involving handling personal data whilst adhering to data privacy regulations, such as the European Union (EU)’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).</p>

											<p>During this first unit, I had the chance to appreciate the fundamentals of secure software development and contribute to a collaborative discussion on information system failures. In that instance, I wrote and shared a post with my colleagues with focus on a failure of an AI-based system that was meant to guide investment decisions, and shared ideas on how such a failure could have been avoided by design.</p>

												<h3>Unit 4: Exploring Programming Language Concepts</h3>

											<p>During this unit, I had the chance to apply OOP-related principles in Python further by carrying out coding exercises on encapsulation, polymorphism, including operator overloading for changing the behaviour of built-in Python functions to suit specific custom purposes, and using private (class) attributes and methods. Building on my Java-related knowledge about getters and setters, I had the opportunity to create them in Python in two ways, i.e., using property decorators and via the ‘property’ built-in function. The codes I developed throughout these exercises can be accessed by clicking 'LEARN MORE' below.</p>

											<p>Throughout this unit, I practised further on UML by creating class, sequence, and activity diagrams for a doctor’s surgery, which can be accessed by clicking ‘LEARN MORE’ below. Whilst the class diagram represents all classes in the proposed software system, the sequence diagram illustrates the main steps involved in the process a patient must follow to be able to book an appointment with a doctor. Instead, the activity diagram shows the required checks and operations that a receptionist may perform to book an appointment for a patient.</p>

I also completed an assignment on a software system design to help in managing self-service checkouts at a supermarket, which involves a related UML class diagram, including its classes and their relationships. Click on 'LEARN MORE' below to view this assignment. In this instance, I learnt how to wear the user’s (customer’s) hat and empathise with their pain points to drive the design of the information system based on their needs and operations involved when scanning items at a self-service checkout. This way of thinking enabled me to design the system such that the customer’s experience is as seamless as possible, from the start to the end of this process. Furthermore, I appreciated the lecturer’s feedback and leveraged it as an external reviewer to improve the clarity of the relationships represented on the class diagram, as demonstrated in subsequent units’ artefacts, such as in unit 8.</p>

Thus, I shared <a href="https://github.com/marianne-manaog/oois-python-sql-uml/blob/main/src/unit_8_exercises/Alternatives_to_SQL_collaborative_discussion.docx">this post</a> on my findings with my colleagues as a part of a collaborative discussion, following which I created a 3NF-compliant entity relationship diagram (ERD) representing a (NoSQL) Graph DB data model for a common related use case, i.e., card fraud detection, and the underlying entities ('tables') and their relationships.

Furthermore, as an assignment, given a UML class diagram, I implemented a Python-based software system focused on leveraging OOP-related design to help in managing a doctor’s surgery’s appointment scheduling’s and prescriptions’ workflows, which can be accessed by clicking 'LEARN MORE' below. In this instance, I practised further on how to understand the patient’s (user’s) journey through the process of booking an appointment and requesting a prescription at a doctor’s surgery. By leveraging the UML class diagram with the expected classes and their relationships, I could appreciate the various interactions and constraints involved in such workflows, and how they can be represented via an object-oriented design and implementation. Thus, I designed the application to leverage OOP-related best practices to streamline the user’s experience and ensure all business and technical requirements were strictly adhered to.</p>
